GYO for query: Answer() :- R(y,z),R(x,y),R(z,x),R(z,x,y)
We remove the ear: Set(y, z)
Current hypergraph edges are: {x, y}; {z, x}; {z, x, y}
We remove the ear: Set(x, y)
Current hypergraph edges are: {z, x}; {z, x, y}
We remove the ear: Set(z, x)
Current hypergraph edges are: {z, x, y}
We remove the ear: Set(z, x, y)
Current hypergraph edges are: 
Algorithm terminate with an empty query
GYO for query: Answer() :- R(x,y),R(y,z),R(x,z)
no more ears
